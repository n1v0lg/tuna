A prototype web framework for secure two-party computation.

One party is the web server, the other a browser client. Based on the Paillier cryptosystem.

## Installing

```
npm install
```

node index.js
```

Open http://localhost:8080/ in browser.

This will run the sum of squares example protocol.

There are several other example protocols implemented inside index.js.
